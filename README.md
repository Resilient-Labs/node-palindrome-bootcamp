# How it was made:
#### HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, API, JSON, Node.js

# Optimizations:
#### Press the button and it will check if it is a palindrome!

# Lesson Learned:
#### You can simplify the JSON responses sent by creating a function that will filter and send only the required pieces of data, instead of sending the entire response or object. This way, you can easily display the information in the browser without needed to sort through all of the data sent back from the server side.
