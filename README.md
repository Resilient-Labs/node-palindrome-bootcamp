# ↔️ Project: Server Side Palindrome Checker

### What I did to build this app: 
I used HTML, CSS, but mainly used JavaScript, Node.js, and JSON

I set up my server to respond to a string submitted by a user. I then used the array methods toLowerCase(), split(), join(), and reverse() to check if the user's string was equal to the same string but backwards.

I also set up my JSON and JavaScript to show that if it was a palindrome or not to the user. 

### Lessons Learned:
* Honing in on my array methods was very helpful with this project.
* Having a strong knowledge for my conditional statements also helped
* I built the habit of restarting my server with node as well.
