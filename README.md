## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript

Created a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules to validate if a string is a palindrome via server side along with HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT. My learning focused on learning more the breakdown of a server-side app and learning more about the http and fs modules.  

## Reflections:

I actually didn't know what Palindrome meant, so I looked it up. I found it interesting to build and learned a lot with my team.
