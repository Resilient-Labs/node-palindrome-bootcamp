## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I created a variable that says any word you put into the input should be ".split('').reverse().join('')". Then that value should equal to the original word.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned .split('') turns every letter in the string its on into an array, whereas .split(' ') turns every word in the string its on into an array.
