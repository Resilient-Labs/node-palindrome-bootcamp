# ðŸ“‹ Server Side Palindrome Checker

![Preview](/img/preview.png)

### Goal:

- Create a simple node app that lets a user enter a string. The app will then let the user know if the string is a palindrome or not. The javascript app logic is rendered on the server side (server.js). The DOM manipulation is done in the (main.js). The node Express framework is not used for this project.
