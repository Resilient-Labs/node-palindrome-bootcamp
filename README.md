 Server Side Palindrome Checker![Screenshot (33)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96151200/171784651-faffdf39-1bd9-4f27-b5dc-b9f85b0821f7.png)


### Goal: Create a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules to validate if a string is a palindrome server side.

Feel free to use this code how you see fit! You will need to install npm however and run this code on your own localhost server otherwise it will not 
work! Have fun trying to see if current or made-up words you may want to check are actually palindromes! Enjoy!!
