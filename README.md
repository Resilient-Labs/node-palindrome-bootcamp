# ↔️ Week08 Bootcamp2019a Project: Server Side Palindrome Checker

### Goal: Create a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules to validate if a string is a palindrome server side.

### How to submit your code for review:

### Process:

<ol>
  <li>Once again, not too bad on the APIs after with them for a while.</li>
  <li>On the server-side JS, I had created a function that check if the userInput, in this case, the word to be assessed as a palindrome or not, was equal to the same word backwards.</li>
  <li>After calling that function and check if "palindrome" was in the parameters (checks if it is a palindrome), I then created a JSON object to have the status of 'palindrome' or 'not-palindrome'.</li>
   <li>I then had the client-side JS grab that status, run it against the userInput, and then return 'Yes, [userInput] is a palindrome' and 'No' if not.</li>
  <li>And that's about it.  Nothing too intense.</li>

<p>Overall, Marvelous.  A testiment to how adapted I have become to APIs.  I am they.  They are me.  We are one.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I completed the challenge: | 5 <em>Ate that.</em></li>
  <li>I feel good about my code: | 5 <em>It works and it works well.  Good job, me.</em></li>
</ul>
