### How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

After creating the HTML for the project, I created two differnt types of JavaSccript files. In one file , a function was created to allow for a click event to happen. In that function it also allows for the DOM to display if the word or string entered in a palindrome.In the other file created it contains the logic behind verifying if the word or string entered is a palindrome.


### What I learned:

This project has taught me how to display my projects on the server-side as opposed to the client-side.
