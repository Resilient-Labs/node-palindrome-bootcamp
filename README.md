# Palindrome Checker
#### Project Scope: Create an application that checks if a word is a palindrome utilizing Node.js to run the process on a back end server.

# How it was made:
#### HTML5, CSS3, Javascript E6, JSON, API, Node.js

# Optimizations:
#### The word that is input through the main.js is sent to the server through the simple API in parameters. To check for a palindrome, I used the .split(), .reverse() and .join() methods and an if conditional. 

# Lesson Learned: 
#### To connect the main.js with Node, I used the fetch method and created a simple API to retrieve data from the server.
