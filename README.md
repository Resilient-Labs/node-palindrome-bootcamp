# palindrome-checker

This is a palindrome checker where the user can input a word and check whether or not it is a palindrome. The reversed word will be returned for the user to see.

### How It's Made:

This project uses Node.js for the back-end code. After the user inputs a word and clicks enter, their request is sent to the server. After the request is received and processed by the server, the server sends a response: the word in reverse and whether it is a palindrome or not.


### Lesson Learned

I learned how to use Node.js to create a server on the back-end.
