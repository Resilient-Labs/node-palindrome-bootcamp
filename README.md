# Palindrome
A palindrome is a phrase/word that you can read both forwards and backwards. In this project, the user can enter a word or phrase and depending if their answer is true or false it will appear on the browser.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS

This is a full-stack application where a user can input a word or phrase and through JS they will know if it is indeed a palindrome or not. I created an api that holds the functionality of the palindrome checker. An if statement which contains a .split , .reverse , .join to reverse the input and confirm if it is a palindrome or not.


## Lessons Learned:

The lesson here is that both the server and client side work differently. With that in mind, I created the backend holding all of the functionality within the server.js. Everything in the main.js file is what the client can see. Within my api I targeted the object and soon after connected both the css and the client side js.
