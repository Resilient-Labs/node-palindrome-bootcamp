# Server Side Node.js Palindrome Checker

### Goal: Create a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules to validate if a string is a palindrome server side.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

This was one of the first projects I created using Node.js. It is challenging to understand at first, but after going through some other projects and watching Node.js crash course videos, I was able to create this server side palindrome checker.

## Lessons Learned:

Looking forward to learning more on backend development and how to use frameworks to make the code more modern. I am still getting used to the syntax and using java script to do this as well.
