# ↔️ Node Server Side Palindrome Checker

A simple web application that uses the fs and http modules to validate if a string is a palindrome server side.

# How it's made
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

# Lessons learned:
This project helped me get familiar with the require() function which is built-in CommonJS module function supported in Node.js that lets you include modules within your project. This is a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules. The http module was used to create the server and fs module was used to read the HTML file.

This project was built using raw Node.js. I have a deep apprecation for Express as a result of this.
