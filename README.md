# ↔️ Server Side Palindrome Checker
This is a website where the user can enter a word or phrase and the server will tell the user if its a palindrome.

## Languages Used

This was created using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Node.js.

This project was done as a team. We created a checker object in the server file that has the properties of a regular expression and the user's string. It also has a method that returns whether the string is a palindrome.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to use a regular expression. We used it to ignore special characters in our palindrome checker method.
